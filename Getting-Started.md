You probably want to have BagelBot before anything else, so let's start with that. 
To install BagelBot, run this command, it's that simple!

**1.** `pastebin run LGwrkjxm`

The installer installs [Eric Wieser's](https://github.com/eric-wieser/) [computercraft-github](https://github.com/eric-wieser/computercraft-github), a github repository downloader that is necessary to download the bot, and the plugins that can be installed.
