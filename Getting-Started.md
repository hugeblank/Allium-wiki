## What's BagelBot?
Welcome, I suppose you're probably here because you have no idea what you're doing so I guess the best way to start would be to explain what BagelBot is. BagelBot is a Lua plugin loader/API for ComputerCraft. Those are some big words, so let me break it down for you. A plugin loader, particularly for Minecraft adds commands to the game to make playing a lot more fun. Plugins could be compared to mods, and BagelBot could be compared to Forge, the loader of these mods. However this isn't a perfect example because plugins actually do exist outside of Forge. Plugins primarily are added to servers to allow the servers to manipulate how the game works. Unlike mods however, plugins only manipulate things on the server and so the player can have a vanilla client, and join a plugin loaded server. With that said, BagelBot could now be copared to Sponge, a well known plugin loader for Minecraft. 

## Why should I use it?
Now comes the question, why does BagelBot even exist? You have to install Computercraft and other mods in order to join a server with BagelBot on it, so what's the point? My answer to that is simply, java is excessive. It's a very advanced language with many concepts that are hard to grasp. To make a plugin you need to not only understand Java, but also the API library that the plugin loader provides, which could be huge. This could be very ominous for someone that just wants to develop a plugin that does a simple task like teleport a player around. Enter BagelBot. BagelBot uses ComputerCraft's native Lua 5.2, which is significantly easier to learn than Java. Along with that, the API for BagelBot is very simple and easy to understand.

## How to Install
You probably want to have BagelBot before anything else, so let's start with that. 
To install BagelBot, paste this into the command line, it's that simple!

The installer installs [Eric Wieser's](https://github.com/eric-wieser/) [computercraft-github](https://github.com/eric-wieser/computercraft-github), a github repository downloader that is necessary to download the bot, and the plugins that can be installed.
