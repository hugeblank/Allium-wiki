# Stem Plugin Commands

Allium comes with a few default commands that you might want to be made aware of. I call these commands Allium's Stem. All of the code for these commands can be found in the `plugins/allium-stem.lua` file.
***

## !allium:help

A friendly help menu that gives information about every plugin and command that you have installed.
***

## !allium:credits

Provides a link to the Allium repository, and attributions to all libraries used to bring Allium together.
***

## !allium:plugins

Lists all plugins that are installed, based on the name they registered with. Hovering over a plugin name will provide the version of the plugin. Clicking on the plugin name will reveal the plugins credits, if implemented.
